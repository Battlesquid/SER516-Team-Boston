/**
 * PBHealth class is responsible for calculating and visualizing the health of the Product Backlog.
 * The health is determined by analyzing the distribution of User Stories across different states
 * (New, In Progress, Done, and Testing) within Sprints. This analysis helps in understanding
 * the readiness of the backlog for future sprints, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring a balanced
 * workload throughout the development process.
 * 
 * Calculation Model:
 * - Health Score = (WeightedSum(Done) + WeightedSum(InProgress) + WeightedSum(New)) / TotalUserStories
 *   - Where WeightedSum(State) = Sum(UserStoriesInState * StateWeight)
 *   - StateWeights reflect the priority of having stories in certain states, e.g., Done > InProgress > New
 * - Additionally, the age of User Stories in each state can be analyzed to identify stale items.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - Sprint: The current Sprint context to analyze User Stories' distribution.
 * - UserStoriesInNew: ObservableList tracking User Stories in the 'New' state.
 * - UserStoriesInProgress: ObservableList tracking User Stories in 'In Progress'.
 * - UserStoriesInDone: ObservableList tracking User Stories marked as 'Done'.
 * - UserStoriesInTesting: Tracks User Stories in 'Testing' if applicable.
